# Full Stack open CI/CD

This repository is used for the CI/CD module of the Full stack open course

## comments from FC:
* At exercise 11.16, leave a blank after "DEFAULT_BUMP" and other field names and enter the value "patch".Otherwise it returns an error.
* At exercise 11.17, I had  "Your account has reached its concurrent builds limit" ,but now it fixed itself.
* At exercise 11.18, #skip should have no blanks between them.
* At exercise 11.19, seems the token is invalid. Got 403 error.

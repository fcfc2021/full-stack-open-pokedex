# Full Stack open CI/CD

This repository is used for the CI/CD module of the Full stack open course

## comments from FC:
*At exercise 11.16, leave a blank after "DEFAULT_BUMP" and other field names and enter the value "patch".Otherwise it returns an error.
*At exercise 11.17, I have  "Your account has reached its concurrent builds limit" , so I will try it later and leave the red dots.

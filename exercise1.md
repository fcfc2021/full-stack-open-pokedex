The language I picked beside JavaScript is Python.

According to the webpage(https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/ci/), there are a few tools I can use to take care of CI setup. Jenkins is the CI engine. Buildbot is the python system to automate the compile/test cycle to validate code changes. Tox is the automation tool providing packaging, testing, and deployment of Python software from the console or CI server.Travis-CI is a distributed CI server that builds tests for open source projects for free. Those are the tools that might be helpful for me to set up the CI/CD.

As for the server, I will start from using the cloud-based environment and gradually change to a self-hosted server. When our project is small and simple, the cloud-based environment offers the quickest service. We can use it to attract users and test our projects. As the project grows and the traffic increases, there would be a tip point where the cost of build time equals the cost of renting a server. We will switch to our own server by then.Also, if we have more teams on the project, or if we work on very sensitive information , we have to choose a self-hosted server and config it by ourselves.
